# Composition of embeddings (e.g. word embeddings, sentence embeddings)

`pip install embcomp`

```python
import embcomp

x=torch.randn(3,10)
y=torch.randn(3,10)

t=torch.randn(3,10)

# combine compositions by concatenating their output 
embcomp.cat([embcomp.complexprod, embcomp.abs])(x,y)
```

This package provide helpers for composition of embeddings. I particularly recommend trying out embcomp.complexprod prod instead of embcomp.prod and embcomp.analogy instead of embcomp.absdiff for asymmetric tasks (e.g. natural language inference.).
